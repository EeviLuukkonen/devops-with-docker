Dockerfile for flask app before optimizations and security improvements:

```
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y \
    gcc \
    libpq-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install flask gunicorn

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

Dockerfile after changes:

```
FROM python:3.9-slim AS build

WORKDIR /app

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y \
        gcc \
        libpq-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
    && adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" appuser \
    && chown -R appuser:appuser /app

USER appuser

COPY --chown=appuser:appuser requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY --chown=appuser:appuser . .


FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build --chown=appuser:appuser /app .

EXPOSE 5000

RUN chown -R appuser:appuser /app

USER appuser

CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

Even though the optimized version is longer and looks more complicated, the image size is significantly smaller.
This is because the optimized version implements multi stage build and combines RUN commands during building.
This version also adds a non-root user for improved security.
