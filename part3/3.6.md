## Backend

At the start, the Dockerfile was

```
FROM golang:1.16

ENV REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost

RUN useradd -m myuser

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .

RUN go build

EXPOSE $PORT

CMD ["./server"]

USER myuser
```

The size of the image is 1.07GB.

```
FROM golang:1.16

ENV REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5000

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .

RUN useradd -m myuser && \
    go build && \
    chmod +x server

USER myuser

CMD ["./server"]
```

After joining the run commands the file is about the same size, but it has fewer layers.
